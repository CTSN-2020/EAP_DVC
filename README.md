# Employee Attrition Prediction

This project predicts whether an employee is likely to leave the company (attrition) based on historical HR data.

✅ **Key Features:**
- Machine Learning model trained on employee data
- Uses features like job role, satisfaction, work environment, etc.
- Includes a saved model file (`employee_attrition_model.pkl`) for deployment
- DVC used for data and model versioning

📦 **Project Files:**
- `Employee_Attrition_Prediction.ipynb` → Jupyter notebook with data analysis and model building
- `employee_attrition_model.pkl` → Trained model file
- `app.py` → Flask API for serving predictions
- `requirements.txt` → Python dependencies

🚀 **How to Run:**
1. Clone the repo  
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
3. Run the app: `python app.py`
